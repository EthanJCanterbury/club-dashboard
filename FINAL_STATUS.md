# âœ… Application Status - FULLY FUNCTIONAL

## Test Date
October 23, 2025 - Final Testing & Fixes

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Admin Dashboard Template
**Issue**: Template path was `admin/dashboard.html` but actual file is `admin_dashboard.html`
**Fixed**: Changed template reference to `admin_dashboard.html`

### 2. âœ… Dashboard Clubs Not Showing
**Issue**: Dashboard wasn't passing both `memberships` and `led_clubs` to template
**Fixed**: Updated dashboard route to pass both variables, matching original behavior

### 3. âœ… Status Banner API Endpoint  
**Issue**: `/api/status/banner` endpoint was returning 404
**Fixed**: 
- Added endpoint to status blueprint
- Fixed `StatusIncident` model query (use `status != 'resolved'` instead of `is_resolved=False`)
- Fixed field names (`impact` instead of `severity`)
