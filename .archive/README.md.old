## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL database
- Required environment variables (see Configuration section)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or fork on Replit
2. Highly recommended to use a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
   If using Replit, this step is handled automatically.
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up environment variables (see Configuration section)
5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

The application will be available at `http://0.0.0.0:5000`

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
